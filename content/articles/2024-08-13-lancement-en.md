Welcome to this new website! Here, I'll be writing about **DIY music gear** -- in particular about effects pedal and other gear for electric guitar.

As I've been building DIY effects pedal and mods for a year, this will be the place where I share these experiences and other reflections on this hobby. I may write about **DIY design and manufacturing techniques**, explain some **mods** I implemented in kits or commercial pedals, perhaps do some **circuit analysis**, or share **ressources** on this hobby.

See you soon!
